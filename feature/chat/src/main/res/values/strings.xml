  <string name="about_content">
    GOV.UK Chat is an experimental AI tool, designed to make it easier to find answers from the pages of GOV.UK. Ask it a question and it will use GOV.UK guidance to quickly find an answer.\n\n
    You can use it to find out more about topics, services and information on GOV.UK. You can also explore the answers in more detail by asking follow-up questions.\n\n
    ## Double-check your answers\n
    AI tools can sometimes make mistakes. For example, they can hallucinate. This is when they confidently provide false information or facts. GOV.UK Chat is designed to minimise the risk of hallucinations.\n\n
    It only uses GOV.UK guidance to answer questions. And with each answer, it provides links to the GOV.UK pages it uses. This makes it simple to double-check the information it gives you.\n
    ## Start new chats\n
    GOV.UK Chat uses your previous messages as context to interpret and answer new questions.\n\n
    You can clear your chats if you want to ask about something new. This will remove your previous messages and make your answers more accurate.\n\n
    If you do this, youâ€™ll no longer have access to your previous questions and answers.\n
    ## More information about GOV.UK Chat\n
    GOV.UK Chat is powered by the same large language model (LLM) thatâ€™s used on Claude, Anthropicâ€™s generative AI chatbot.\n\n
